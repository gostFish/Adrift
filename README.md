# Adrift

This Repo is a clone of the Original collaborative work between Myself, Leonel Bonnici, Matthew Schembri, Michele Perrino, Kristiine Parna and David Brincat (Though levels of contribution are significantly scewed to the first 3 mentioned)
  Matthew Schembri: Team lead (Client communication, presentation, team coordination and most of the Document writing)
  Leonel Bonnici:  Team Artist and Story Writer (Created most Original assets, implemented the story aspect)
  Malcolm Grech (me): Team Programmer (Wrote vast majority of Scripting and UI, implemented mechanics and managed the Game Scene)

The Game is a finished product as a Narrative-based Game, but is planned to be extended after the Dungeon of StoneFang is reworked.

This Repo has been Archived for Data privacy Reasons, but may be played by downloading the Builds folder.
